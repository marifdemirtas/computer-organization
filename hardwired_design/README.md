##Â Project 3 - Hardwired Computer Design

This folder contains the design of a hardwired control unit for the system designed in project 2. Instruction format can be found in the PDF file under this folder. Additionally, example programs can be found under the folder `examples`. 

We additionally provide a `assembler.py` file, written in Python. It implements a basic assembler program that looks for `in.txt` file that contains a program written according to the described instruction format and generates its machine code equivalent `out.txt`. This output can be directly loaded into Logisim RAM.
