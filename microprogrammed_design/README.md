##Â Project 4 - Microprogrammed Computer Design

This folder contains the design of a software-based control unit for a modified version of the system designed in project 2. Instruction format can be found in the PDF file under this folder. Additionally, example alternative microprograms can be found under the folder `example_rom`. 

We additionally provide a `microprogrammer.py` file, written in Python. It implements a basic program that looks for `in.txt` file that contains the microprogram written according to the our report, and generates its machine code equivalent `out.txt`. This output can be directly loaded into Logisim ROM.
